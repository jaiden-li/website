    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my Linguistics research portfolio and project page, where I nerd out about linguistics!</p>

    <h2>Where It All Started</h2>
    <p>My first exposure to formal Linguistics came from attending <a href="https://linguistics.osu.edu/undergrad/sliys">Ohio State's Summer Linguistics for Youth Institute</a> (SLIYS, pronounced "slice") in the summer before my sophomore year. Before then, I'd always been passionate about language, but I had no idea that language could be studied as a science.</p>

    <h2>Discovering Computational Linguistics</h2>
    <p>At SLIYS, I discovered the field of computational linguistics. "If a machine has to do X in order to perform this linguistic task, do humans have to do X as well?" This really fascinated me—human language informs machines, but machines can also inform our understanding of human language.</p>

    <h2>Language and Meaning</h2>
    <p>Meanwhile, I was also becoming more interested in translation. As I learned Chinese and French more deeply, I started experimenting with expressing the same idea in different languages. I especially loved the nuance—like how "conscience" in French means both "consciousness" and "conscience."</p>

    <h2>NACLO & Programming</h2>
    <p>In my sophomore year, I began taking <a href="https://naclo.org/">NACLO</a> seriously. I studied, practiced, and eventually qualified for the Invitational Round!</p>
    <p>I also got into competitive programming, especially problems involving strings or language. But when chatting with my friends in China, I realized that programming—in English—was often an extra challenge for them.</p>

    <h2>Bridging Gaps</h2>
    <p>This was a struggle my dad faced as a clinical analyst. So I thought: how could I help? Tutorials in native languages? A Python preprocessor for Chinese coders? I eventually settled on translating competitive programming problems into Chinese.</p>

    <h2>NLP & the Human Brain</h2>
    <p>That summer, I took a class on Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and Semantics with Prof. Mohammed Taher Pilehvar from Cambridge.</p>
