            <p>Welcome to <b>Half-Birthday Chronicles</b>!</p>
            <p>This past weekend, I was at M{IT}^2, MIT's informatics tournament for high school and college students. As usual, what was most memorable about the experience was not the competition or coding aspects (though those were also very fun!)</p>
            <p>For me, it was playing poker in-person for the first time, trying to figure out what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot">Smoot</a> was, and late-night walks around MIT's campus.</p>
            <figure><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/mit_scenery_3.png" alignment="center" width="300px" height="420px"></div></figure>
            <p>While walking around MIT, I experienced a feeling of being <i>alone</i>. It's... hard to describe. Of course, it was quite late at night, so I fully expected to be alone.</p>
            <p>But it was so much more than that. Clutching my phone tight in my hands while taking in the buildings around me and trying not to take too many pictures, I had a feeling of <i>oh, this is it</i>.</p>
            <p>If I become a researcher and an academic like I've always wanted, I'll be walking a path of solitude. I'll always have my friends and family for support, but that journey will be mine and mine alone. It'll be late nights that aren't half as romantic or dreamlike. It'll be staring at screens until that becomes the only function of my eyes. It'll be... well, rough.</p>
            <p>But at the same time, that path is liberating. I can see it so clearly now - I can't imagine myself doing anything else. On nights where I'm working myself to the grindstone, I'll still make the trek across campus, look up at the stars, and briefly, gorgeously, be reminded of my humanity.</p>
            <p>And that'll make it all worth it. What is research if not satisfying our curiosity about the universe? (I'm going to look back on this in a few years and laugh at the naive, idealistic person I am now.)</p>
            <p><blockquote>At the end of the day, we’re all trying to answer the same fundamental questions—Who are we? Where did we come from? What is our purpose? There is beauty in how we humans satisfy our curiosity about the universe, whether it’s smashing protons together in violent collisions or analyzing gendered nouns in classical Chinese texts. While I prefer researching intangible things like language and using non-intrusive research methods, I’ve come to respect the different ways we humans satisfy our curiosity about the universe.

            <p>MIT, for me, represents an intellectual haven of sorts. Yet I know without a doubt that MIT is not the right place for me, at least for undergrad: I still have to learn how to think before I <i>do</i> anything.</p>
            <p>All of the attempts I've made at thinking about things have been flawed, at best. At this moment thoughts are colliding in my head more violently than the smashiest of protons. I just wrote a《figcaption》tag and my brain went, "Sylvia Path's Figcaptions." You see? I'm clearly doomed.</p>
            <p>I'm untrained, yet the raw kinetic energy is there. Or is that just wishful thinking? I'm begging, begging for these colleges to see me, this girl with so much raw intellectual potential, and shape me into some coherent thinker. Not Rousseau or Mengzi, certainly. But someone who can contribute to conversations and offer a unique perspective.</p>
