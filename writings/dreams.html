    <h2>Afterword</h2>
    <p>whew, okay! i have a lot to say for this one. this work was my first attempt at using different writing styles within the same piece, and for the most part, i think it worked pretty well.<br>
        <br>the descriptions of the Red Island are more poetic and whimsical and meant to evoke certain images in the reader's mind that speak to the distant city's surreal, almost dreamlike, quality.<br>
        <br>though the theme of nature persists when talking about the Green Island, there is a greater acknowledgement of reality and the tone shifts to create a more contemplative mood. the clash of idealism and reality is (hopefully) far more apparent here than in the previous section.<br>
        <br>finally, on the Clear Island - with actual dialogue and shorter, more consise statements, it's by far the most grounded of the three. the descriptions are much more concrete and rooted in reality.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        the symbols used were unintentional for the most part, though i have to admit this piece leans heavily on symbolsim. gold clearly represents superficiality, a quality that belongs to things of artificial creation - in other words, byproducts of industrialization. (looking back, i realize
        that actually takes quite a bit of inference on the reader's part. oops.) <br>
        <br>green and blue are closely intertwined with nature - its beauty, but also its destruction. <br>
        <br>red is interesting because while it is mostly used in a revolutionary context, it is also the color of blood, which flows through the "veins of the living things that inhabit this place." <br>
        <br>and of course - the water! the ice! i'll let you ponder this on your own, but you probably get the gist.<br>

        here are some additional things of note:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>all the islands' names are directly translated from Chinese. The word å²› or "dao" means island, and its prefix is an adjective. So "Hongdao" means "Red Island," "Ludao" means "Green Island," etc.</li>
        <li>The Chinese classic <i>Hou Long Meng</i>'s English title is <i>Dreams of the Red Chamber</i>.</li>
    </ol>
